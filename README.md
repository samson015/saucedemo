SauceDemo E-commerce Test Automation Solution
This repository features a comprehensive automated testing solution for SauceDemo.com, a sample e-commerce website, developed with Playwright and JavaScript. The project demonstrates a commitment to industry-standard test automation best practices, including:
End-to-End Functional Testing:
    User Authentication:  Verifies successful and unsuccessful login scenarios.
    Product Catalog Interaction: Confirms the ability to browse and view detailed product information.
    Shopping Cart Management: Ensures seamless adding and removal of items from the cart.
    Secure Checkout Flow: Simulates the complete order placement process, culminating in order confirmation.
Architectural Excellence: Leverages the Page Object Model (POM) to create a maintainable, reusable, and scalable test suite.
Browser Compatibility: Guarantees consistent application behavior by executing tests across multiple web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
Reporting & Analysis: Generates detailed test reports, providing clear insights into test execution and application quality.

This project highlights my ability to design and implement robust, efficient, and maintainable test automation frameworks.

Key Technologies: Playwright, JavaScript
